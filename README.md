Parallelized Psuedo-Potential Lattice Boltzmann Simulation for Two-Phase Droplet Collision.

This repository contains a parallelized lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) code implemented in GNU Fortran for simulating the head-on collision of two viscous droplets. The code utilizes the D2Q9 model and is designed to run efficiently on systems with shared memory using OpenMP.

This simulation models the head-on collision of two droplets in a two-phase system using the lattice Boltzmann method with a pseudo-potential Shan-Chen model and D2Q9 model. The domain is periodic and consists of 1,000,000 nodes. This project is aimed at developing a high performance simulator of two-phase flows.

Features
Model: D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann model for two-phase flows.

Parallelization: Utilizes OpenMP for efficient computation on multi-core processors.

Compiler: Compatible with GNU Fortran 11.4.0.

Domain: Simulates a large periodic domain with 1,000,000 nodes.


Prerequisites:
Before you clone the repository and run the simulation, ensure you have the following installed:

GNU Fortran (gfortran) 11.4.0 or later
OpenMP support within the compiler
Make (for building the executable)
